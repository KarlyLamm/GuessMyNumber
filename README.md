# GuessMyNumber
This project was to practice using JQuery callbacks by generating a random number using Math.random, analyzing user input against this number, and providing feedback if the guess was too high, too low, or correct. Guesses are shown with bullets, as well as the option to reveal the number, and clear the guesses and answers.
